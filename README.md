# rita-bot-ws
Workspace Repository for the Rita Robot

# Tipps:
- use `colcon build --symlink-install` option to create symlinks instead of copies so you don't need to rebuild when tweaking certain files.

- submodule and main repo have to be pushed seperately. Also for the main repo the submodule has to be staged seperately to update the hash pointing to the submodule version.
